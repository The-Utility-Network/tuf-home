            heading: 'The Return of the Sacred',
            content: `The modern world has often been described as disenchanted—stripped of the sacred meanings that once gave life coherence and purpose. The gods have departed, the great narratives have collapsed, and we are left with mere mechanism, mere market, mere matter in motion. Many have experienced this as loss, and in response have retreated to religious fundamentalism or spiritual escapism.

**Max Weber** (1864-1920), the great sociologist of modernity, gave us the term "disenchantment" (Entzauberung) to describe this process. For Weber, rationalization—the extension of calculative, means-ends thinking to all domains of life—necessarily expelled the magical and the mysterious. Science explained what religion had mystified; bureaucracy organized what tradition had sanctified; capitalism commodified what community had held sacred.

But Weber was a diagnostician, not a prophet. He described what had happened, not what must happen. The disenchantment of the world was a historical process, contingent and reversible, not a metaphysical necessity. The question for us is not whether to accept disenchantment but how to reimagine the sacred in forms adequate to contemporary understanding.

Creative Utilitarianism offers a different response to the crisis of meaning. It recognizes that the sacred was never resident in supernatural beings or metaphysical abstractions but was always immanent to life itself—to the creative advance of the universe, to the flourishing of capabilities, to the joy of genuine community. The disenchantment of the modern world is not the death of the sacred but the clearing of ground for its rediscovery in new forms.

This does not mean the abandonment of traditional religions. For billions of people worldwide, the great traditions continue to provide meaning, community, and ethical guidance. Creative Utilitarianism engages these traditions not as opponents but as conversation partners, seeking the wisdom they contain while acknowledging the limitations of their historical forms.`

            heading: 'Hinduism: Unity in Multiplicity',
            content: `**Hinduism**, the world's oldest living religion, offers resources for Creative Utilitarian thought that are often overlooked in Western philosophy. The tradition is not a single unified system but a vast family of philosophies, practices, and communities, united by a shared heritage rather than a common creed.

The central concepts of Hindu philosophy resonate with Creative Utilitarianism:

**Brahman**, the ultimate reality, is not a personal God in the Western sense but the ground of all being, the consciousness that pervades and sustains the universe. The Upanishads teach that Atman (the individual self) is identical with Brahman—"Tat tvam asi," you are that. This is not absorption of the individual into the universal but recognition that individual and universal are not ultimately separate. Compare Whitehead's understanding of each occasion as including the whole universe within itself.

**Dharma** is cosmic order and individual duty, the pattern of righteousness that should govern both universe and conduct. Unlike Western conceptions of morality as external command, dharma is immanent—the way things naturally are when functioning properly. The capability of an individual is to realize their svadharma, their own particular path within the cosmic order.

**Karma** is the law of action and consequence, the principle that every action produces effects that shape future experience. This is not fate but agency—we create our own karma through our choices, and we can transform our karma through wisdom and practice. Creative Utilitarianism extends this to collective karma: societies create conditions that produce suffering or flourishing for future generations.

**Moksha** is liberation—not escape from the world but freedom from the illusions that cause suffering. The enlightened person acts without attachment to results, serving the world without being trapped by desire. This is the spiritual equivalent of what Deleuze and Guattari call deterritorialization: freedom from the structures that constrain creative flow.

The philosophical schools of Hinduism offer diverse perspectives:

**Advaita Vedanta**, articulated by **Shankara** (c. 788-820 CE), teaches non-duality: there is only Brahman, and the appearance of separate selves and objects is maya, illusion. This radical monism has influenced Western thinkers from Schopenhauer to Aldous Huxley.

**Vishishtadvaita**, articulated by **Ramanuja** (1017-1137 CE), teaches qualified non-duality: individual selves and the world are real but exist as attributes of Brahman, as the body exists in relation to the soul. This preserves both unity and diversity, allowing for genuine relationship with the divine.

**Yoga**, as systematized by **Patanjali** (c. 2nd century BCE), provides practices for realizing these truths experientially. The eight limbs of yoga—ethical precepts, physical postures, breath control, sensory withdrawal, concentration, meditation, and absorption—represent a comprehensive technology of self-transformation.

**Bhakti** (devotion) traditions emphasize love for a personal deity—Krishna, Shiva, Devi—as the path to liberation. The great bhakti poets—**Kabir** (1440-1518), **Mirabai** (1498-1546), **Tukaram** (1608-1649)—sang of divine love that transcended caste, gender, and religious boundaries.

**Mahatma Gandhi** (1869-1948) articulated a modern Hindu ethics centered on ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (truth-force). For Gandhi, non-violence was not passivity but active resistance to injustice through moral means. His methods inspired liberation movements worldwide, from the American civil rights movement to anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa.`

            heading: 'Buddhism: The Middle Way',
            content: `**Buddhism**, arising from Hinduism in the 6th century BCE, offers a sophisticated analysis of suffering and liberation that has much to teach Creative Utilitarianism. The Buddha (**Siddhartha Gautama**, c. 563-483 BCE) rejected both strict asceticism and sensual indulgence, teaching a Middle Way that avoids extremes.

The Four Noble Truths articulate the Buddhist diagnosis:

1. **Dukkha**: Life as ordinarily lived involves suffering—not only obvious pain but also the subtler unsatisfactoriness of impermanence and unfulfillment.

2. **Samudaya**: The origin of suffering is craving—tanha, the thirst that grasps for pleasure and pushes away pain, the attachment to fixed identities and permanent possessions.

3. **Nirodha**: Suffering can be ended through the cessation of craving—not by getting what we want but by transforming the wanting itself.

4. **Magga**: The path to this cessation is the Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

The Buddhist analysis resonates with the capability approach. Both focus not on possessing things but on states of being and doing. Both recognize that subjective satisfaction is inadequate as a measure of well-being—the adapted preferences of the oppressed are not genuine flourishing. Both emphasize practice over doctrine, transformation over belief.

**Theravada Buddhism**, dominant in Southeast Asia, preserves what it considers the original teachings of the Buddha. Its meditation practices—vipassana (insight) and samatha (calm)—have been studied scientifically and adapted for therapeutic purposes. **Jon Kabat-Zinn** (b. 1944) developed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, now widely used in hospitals and clinics.

**Mahayana Buddhism**, dominant in East Asia, expanded the Buddhist project from individual liberation to universal salvation. The bodhisattva—one who vows to remain in the world until all beings are liberated—represents a commitment to collective flourishing that echoes Creative Utilitarian goals. **Nagarjuna** (c. 150-250 CE), founder of the Madhyamaka school, developed a sophisticated philosophy of emptiness (sunyata) that deconstructs all fixed categories while affirming the conventional reality of the world.

**Zen Buddhism**, which developed in China and Japan, emphasizes direct insight over doctrinal study. The koan—a paradoxical statement or question meant to provoke awakening—and zazen (seated meditation) are means for awakening to our original nature. **Dogen** (1200-1253), founder of Soto Zen in Japan, taught that practice and enlightenment are not separate: to sit in meditation is already to be Buddha.

**Tibetan Buddhism** preserves the tantric tradition, using visualization, mantra, and ritual to transform ordinary experience into enlightened experience. **The Dalai Lama** (Tenzin Gyatso, b. 1935), the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism in exile, has engaged extensively with science and philosophy, arguing that Buddhist and scientific worldviews can mutually enrich each other.

**Engaged Buddhism**, developed by **Thich Nhat Hanh** (1926-2022) and others, applies Buddhist principles to social action. Mindfulness is not escape from the world but full presence to it, including its suffering and injustice. Right action includes political action; right livelihood includes right economy. Engaged Buddhism provides a model for spiritually grounded activism that Creative Utilitarianism can learn from.`

            heading: 'Judaism: Covenant and Justice',
            content: `**Judaism**, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, centers on covenant—the relationship between God and the Jewish people, established with Abraham and renewed at Sinai. This covenantal framework has implications for political as well as religious life.

The Hebrew prophets—**Isaiah**, **Jeremiah**, **Amos**, **Micah**—articulated a vision of social justice that remains powerful today. "Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream" (Amos 5:24). The prophetic tradition insists that religious observance is meaningless without justice, that God cares more about the treatment of the poor than about ritual correctness.

**Tikkun olam**—repair of the world—is a concept that has become central to progressive Jewish identity. Originally a kabbalistic term referring to cosmic restoration, it has been democratized to mean social action for justice. Every act of justice, compassion, and creation contributes to the repair of a broken world.

**The Torah** (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) contains extensive legislation concerning economic justice: the sabbath year that releases debts, the jubilee that restores land to original owners, prohibitions on interest and exploitation, requirements to leave gleanings for the poor. These laws, whatever their historical observance, represent a vision of economic life ordered toward justice rather than accumulation.

**Rabbinic Judaism**, developed after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, created a portable religion not tied to territory or temple. The centrality of study, ethical debate, and community has enabled Judaism to survive diaspora and persecution. The Talmudic tradition of argumentation—preserving minority opinions, exploring contradictions—represents a model of communal reasoning that Creative Utilitarianism can draw upon.

**Maimonides** (1138-1204), the great medieval philosopher, harmonized Judaism with Aristotelian philosophy. His eight levels of charity—from reluctant giving to creating conditions where charity is unnecessary—represent a capability-oriented understanding of justice. The highest charity is to enable the poor to become self-sufficient, to invest in their capabilities rather than merely meeting their needs.

**Martin Buber** (1878-1965), the philosopher of dialogue, articulated the distinction between I-It and I-Thou relationships. I-It relationships treat the other as object, means to my ends; I-Thou relationships encounter the other as subject, in genuine mutuality. For Buber, the I-Thou relationship is the basis of all genuine spirituality and the model for ethical relationships. This resonates with Creative Utilitarianism's emphasis on treating persons as ends, not merely means.

**Emmanuel Levinas** (1905-1995), the French-Lithuanian philosopher, developed a phenomenology of the face-to-face encounter. The face of the other makes an infinite ethical demand on me—prior to any contract, any calculation, any justification. This ethical relationship is the foundation of all human community and the ground of all justice.

**Abraham Joshua Heschel** (1907-1972), the rabbi and activist, marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and opposed the Vietnam War. For Heschel, prophetic religion demands engagement with social justice; prayer without action is hypocrisy. "Prayer is meaningless unless it is subversive," he wrote, "unless it seeks to overthrow and to ruin the pyramids of callousness, hatred, opportunism, falsehoods."`

            heading: 'Christianity: Love and Liberation',
            content: `**Christianity**, born from Judaism in 1st-century Palestine, centers on the person and teachings of **Jesus of Nazareth** (c. 4 BCE - 30 CE). The core teachings of Jesus—love of God and neighbor, forgiveness of enemies, care for the poor—have inspired both oppressive institutions and liberating movements.

The **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5-7) articulates a radically demanding ethic: love your enemies, turn the other cheek, give to all who ask, do not worry about tomorrow. These teachings have been interpreted variously: as impossible ideals meant to reveal human incapacity, as counsels of perfection for religious specialists, or as genuine norms for Christian life. Whatever interpretation one accepts, they represent a vision of human possibility that transcends conventional morality.

**The early church**, as described in Acts, practiced a form of communism: "All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need" (Acts 2:44-45). This radical sharing, whatever its historical extent, represents a vision of economic life that stands in judgment of both capitalist accumulation and socialist bureaucracy.

**Augustine of Hippo** (354-430) developed a sophisticated theology of sin and grace that has shaped Western Christianity. His concept of the City of God—a community of the blessed that transcends earthly institutions—provided both critique of existing societies and hope for transformation. His emphasis on human fallenness, however, has sometimes been used to justify fatalism about social change.

**Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274) synthesized Christian theology with Aristotelian philosophy, developing a natural law tradition that has influenced both Catholic social teaching and secular ethics. The Thomistic understanding of the common good—not merely aggregated individual goods but the good of the community as such—provides a framework for thinking about collective flourishing.

**The Reformation**, initiated by **Martin Luther** (1483-1546) and **John Calvin** (1509-1564), challenged Catholic authority and gave rise to Protestant traditions that emphasized individual conscience and the priesthood of all believers. These principles, whatever their theological origins, contributed to the development of democracy and human rights.

**Liberation Theology**, developed in Latin America by **Gustavo Gutiérrez** (b. 1928), **Leonardo Boff** (b. 1938), and others, reads the Bible from the perspective of the poor. The Exodus story becomes a paradigm for liberation from all forms of oppression; the prophetic tradition demands structural rather than merely charitable response to poverty; Jesus's "preferential option for the poor" requires Christians to side with the marginalized against the powerful.

**The Social Gospel**, developed by **Walter Rauschenbusch** (1861-1918) and others in early 20th-century America, applied Christian ethics to social and economic structures. The kingdom of God was not merely a heavenly hope but a present task: the transformation of unjust institutions into expressions of divine love.

**Martin Luther King Jr.** (1929-1968), the prophet of American civil rights, synthesized the Social Gospel with Gandhian nonviolence and prophetic Christianity. His vision of the "beloved community" represents a form of Creative Utilitarian thought expressed in Christian language: a society where all can flourish, where difference is celebrated rather than suppressed, where justice rolls down like waters.`

            heading: 'Islam: Submission and Justice',
            content: `**Islam**, the youngest of the Abrahamic faiths, was revealed to the Prophet **Muhammad** (570-632 CE) in 7th-century Arabia. The word "Islam" means submission—submission to the will of Allah (God), the same God worshipped by Jews and Christians. This submission, however, is not passive but active: the Muslim is called to establish justice and righteousness on earth.

The **Five Pillars of Islam** structure Muslim life:

1. **Shahada**: The declaration of faith—"There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God."
2. **Salat**: Prayer five times daily, orienting the believer toward Mecca and community.
3. **Zakat**: Obligatory charity, typically 2.5% of savings, for the poor and public benefit.
4. **Sawm**: Fasting during Ramadan, cultivating discipline and solidarity with the hungry.
5. **Hajj**: Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime, uniting Muslims of all nations.

**The Quran**, the holy book of Islam, contains extensive teaching on social justice. "Those who believe and do good works—for them is forgiveness and a mighty reward" (5:9). Faith and action are inseparable; belief that does not manifest in justice is not genuine faith.

**Islamic economics** developed principles that anticipate some aspects of Creative Utilitarianism. **Riba** (usury/interest) is forbidden, preventing the exploitation of debtors and the accumulation of wealth through mere possession rather than productive activity. **Waqf** (charitable endowment) creates perpetual trusts for public benefit—schools, hospitals, mosques—that cannot be privatized or diverted. The principle of **maslaha** (public interest) guides legal reasoning toward outcomes that benefit the community.

**Islamic philosophy** flourished in the medieval period, preserving and extending Greek thought while much of Europe languished in intellectual darkness. **Al-Farabi** (c. 872-950) developed a political philosophy centered on the virtuous city, where philosopher-rulers guide citizens toward flourishing. **Ibn Sina** (Avicenna, 980-1037) synthesized Aristotelian philosophy with Islamic thought. **Ibn Rushd** (Averroes, 1126-1198) defended the compatibility of philosophy and religion, influencing later Christian scholastics including Aquinas.

**Sufism**, the mystical tradition within Islam, emphasizes direct experience of divine love over merely external observance. **Rumi** (1207-1273), the great Persian poet, sang of a love that transcends all boundaries: "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there." **Ibn Arabi** (1165-1240) developed a sophisticated metaphysics of the unity of being, in which all existence is theophany—divine self-disclosure.

**Modern Islamic reform** movements have sought to reconcile Islam with modernity. **Muhammad Abduh** (1849-1905) and his student **Rashid Rida** (1865-1935) advocated a return to the sources of Islam while embracing science and reason. Contemporary thinkers like **Tariq Ramadan** (b. 1962) and **Khaled Abou El Fadl** (b. 1963) engage seriously with Western philosophy while rooting their thought in Islamic tradition.

**Malcolm X** (1925-1965), after his pilgrimage to Mecca, developed a vision of Islam as universal brotherhood transcending race: "I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept in the same bed... while praying to the same God—with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white."`

            heading: 'Indigenous Spiritualities',
            content: `**Indigenous spiritual traditions** across the world offer wisdom that has been suppressed and marginalized by colonialism but remains vital to the construction of a just and sustainable world. These traditions are diverse, tied to specific lands and peoples, and cannot be reduced to a single formula. But certain themes recur that are relevant to Creative Utilitarianism.

**Relationality**: Indigenous worldviews typically understand the world as a web of relationships rather than a collection of separate objects. Humans are kin to other animals, to plants, to the land itself. This ontology stands in sharp contrast to the Western dualism that separates humans from nature and subjects from objects. It resonates with the process philosophy of Whitehead, the rhizomatic thinking of Deleuze and Guattari, and the social ecology of Bookchin.

**Reciprocity**: The relationship between humans and the more-than-human world is understood as reciprocal. We receive gifts from the earth—food, water, shelter, beauty—and we owe gifts in return: care, ceremony, responsibility. This ethic of reciprocity provides a foundation for ecological practice that is lacking in both capitalism (which treats nature as resource to be exploited) and much environmentalism (which treats nature as object to be preserved).

**Place**: Indigenous spiritualities are rooted in specific places—mountains, rivers, forests—that are not fungible, not exchangeable for other places. This attachment to place stands against the abstract space of capitalism, which treats all locations as equivalent sites for extraction and accumulation. Learning to be in place, to care for place, to belong to place—this is a spiritual discipline that industrial civilization has forgotten.

**Intergenerational responsibility**: The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) principle of seven-generation thinking—considering the effects of decisions on seven generations hence—provides a temporal horizon that modern politics, with its four-year election cycles, entirely lacks. Indigenous governance traditionally balanced present needs against responsibilities to ancestors and descendants.

**Robin Wall Kimmerer** (b. 1953), Potawatomi botanist and author, articulates what she calls a "grammar of animacy"—a way of speaking and thinking that recognizes the personhood of all beings. Trees are not "it" but "who." Rivers are not resources but relatives. This linguistic shift is not mere poetry but reflects a different ontology, one in which kinship extends beyond the human.

**Vine Deloria Jr.** (1933-2005), Standing Rock Sioux scholar, provided a powerful critique of Western civilization from an Indigenous perspective. His "Red Earth, White Lies" challenged the Bering Strait migration theory that denies the antiquity of Indigenous presence in the Americas. His "God Is Red" articulated an Indigenous spirituality grounded in place rather than time, in relationship rather than doctrine.

We acknowledge with humility that Creative Utilitarianism emerges from Western philosophical traditions that have been complicit in the destruction of Indigenous peoples and cultures. We cannot simply appropriate Indigenous wisdom without also reckoning with this history. But we can listen, learn, and allow Indigenous perspectives to challenge and transform our inherited categories.`

            heading: 'East Asian Traditions',
            content: `**Confucianism**, **Daoism**, and **Chinese Buddhism** have shaped East Asian civilization for millennia, offering perspectives on social order, natural harmony, and spiritual cultivation that complement and challenge Western thought.

**Confucius** (551-479 BCE) taught a vision of social harmony based on proper relationships. The five relationships—ruler/subject, parent/child, elder/younger, husband/wife, friend/friend—each carry mutual obligations. When roles are fulfilled, society flourishes; when they are neglected, disorder results. This is not hierarchy for its own sake but hierarchy in service of harmony.

**Ren** (benevolence, humaneness) is the supreme Confucian virtue—the quality that makes one genuinely human. Ren is developed through practice, through the cultivation of proper feeling and proper action. The Confucian project is **self-cultivation**—becoming more fully human through education, reflection, and ritual practice.

**Li** (ritual, propriety) provides the forms through which ren is expressed. Rituals are not empty formalities but meaningful practices that shape character and create community. The Confucian understanding of ritual resonates with process philosophy's emphasis on habit and pattern as the structure of reality.

**Mencius** (372-289 BCE) developed a more optimistic Confucianism, arguing that human nature is fundamentally good, though it can be corrupted by circumstances. His political philosophy emphasized the responsibility of rulers to care for the people: rulers who fail forfeit their mandate and may be rightfully overthrown.

**Daoism**, traditionally attributed to **Laozi** (6th century BCE), offers a counterpoint to Confucian activism. The **Dao** (Way) is the ultimate reality, ineffable and nameless, the source and pattern of all things. The sage aligns with the Dao through **wu wei**—non-action, or effortless action that does not force but flows. This is not passivity but attunement to natural process.

**Zhuangzi** (369-286 BCE), the great Daoist sage, conveyed his philosophy through stories, jokes, and paradoxes. His perspectivism—recognizing that every viewpoint is limited—anticipates contemporary relativism while avoiding nihilism. There is a Way, even if no view can capture it fully;wisdom consists in holding views lightly while responding skillfully to circumstances.

The Daoist emphasis on spontaneity and naturalness resonates with Creative Utilitarianism's critique of hierarchy and control. The ideal society, for Daoists, is not engineered but emerges—like water finding its level, like plants growing toward light. Our intervention should enhance rather than override natural processes.

**Chan (Zen) Buddhism**, developed in China from the encounter of Buddhism with Daoism, emphasizes direct insight over doctrinal study. The Zen master uses koans, parables, and even physical blows to provoke awakening—to break through the conceptual mind to direct experience of reality. This tradition has influenced Western artists, philosophers, and therapists, from **John Cage** to **Alan Watts** to the mindfulness movement.

**Neo-Confucianism**, developed in the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE), synthesized Confucianism with Buddhist and Daoist insights. **Zhu Xi** (1130-1200) developed a systematic metaphysics of principle (li) and material force (qi) that served as East Asian orthodoxy for centuries. **Wang Yangming** (1472-1529) developed an idealist version emphasizing the unity of knowledge and action—a theme that anticipates pragmatism.`

            heading: 'Modern Spirituality',
            content: `Beyond the traditional religions, modern spirituality takes diverse forms that attempt to address the existential needs of contemporary life. Some of these forms are problematic—narcissistic self-help, consumerist appropriation, cult-like communities—but others represent genuine efforts to construct meaning in a post-traditional world.

**Secular humanism** affirms human values without supernatural grounding. Organizations like the American Humanist Association and ethical culture societies provide community and ceremony for those who reject traditional religion but seek connection and meaning. The humanist emphasis on reason, science, and human dignity resonates with Creative Utilitarianism, even as we recognize the limitations of secular frameworks for addressing existential questions.

**Unitarian Universalism** draws from multiple sources—Christianity, humanism, earth-centered traditions—while affirming the inherent worth of every person and the interdependence of all existence. UU congregations provide a model of pluralistic community that respects diversity while cultivating commitment.

**Spiritual but not religious** describes a growing population who seek experiential spirituality without institutional affiliation. Practices like meditation, yoga, and psychedelic exploration are understood as technologies for transformation rather than membership in traditions. This seeking is often criticized as superficial or appropriative, but it also represents a genuine hunger for meaning that institutional religion has failed to satisfy.

**Alan Watts** (1915-1973), the British-American philosopher, popularized Eastern thought in the West through books, lectures, and recordings. His playful, paradoxical style made complex ideas accessible without reducing them. His understanding of spirituality as liberation from the ego-illusion, achieved not through effort but through recognition, continues to influence seekers worldwide.

**Thomas Merton** (1915-1968), the Trappist monk and writer, explored the intersection of contemplative Christianity with Eastern thought. His dialogue with Zen masters and his critique of Western materialism from within the Christian tradition modeled a form of interfaith engagement that respects difference while seeking common wisdom.

**Pierre Teilhard de Chardin** (1881-1955), Jesuit priest and paleontologist, developed a mystical evolutionism that saw the universe as developing toward the "Omega Point"—a state of maximum complexity and consciousness. His vision of cosmic evolution as spiritual development resonates with Whitehead's process philosophy and has influenced both religious and secular thinkers.

Creative Utilitarianism affirms that human beings need more than survival, more than comfort, more than entertainment. We need purpose. We need connection. We need the sense that our brief existence contributes to something larger than ourselves. Creative work—work that engages the whole person, that contributes to genuine value, that connects the worker to a community of purpose—is itself a spiritual practice. Not the degraded labor of the assembly line or the cubicle, but creative work that discovers who we are by seeing what we can create.

This is not religion in the traditional sense. It demands no belief in supernatural entities, no submission to institutional authority, no adherence to ancient texts. But it is religious in a deeper sense: it recognizes that meaning is not given but made, that sacred is a quality of commitment not of objects, that the ultimate is encountered not in another world but in the depths of this one.`
