            heading: 'Beyond Scarcity Economics',
            content: `Classical economics begins with scarcity—the assumption that human wants are infinite while resources are limited, and that the fundamental economic problem is the allocation of limited resources to unlimited wants. But this framing, however useful for certain purposes, obscures as much as it reveals. It naturalizes a particular configuration of social relations, presenting as eternal necessity what is in fact historical contingency.

The scarcity framework emerged in a specific historical context: the consolidation of market society in 18th and 19th century Europe. **Adam Smith** (1723-1790), writing at the dawn of industrial capitalism, articulated the mechanisms by which self-interested behavior could generate social coordination through the "invisible hand" of the market. **David Ricardo** (1772-1823) and **Thomas Malthus** (1766-1834) added the iron laws of wages and population that made scarcity seem inevitable. **Alfred Marshall** (1842-1924) formalized these insights into the supply-and-demand framework that remains the foundation of mainstream economics.

This framework has explanatory power for market societies, but it is not neutral. By taking scarcity as fundamental, it naturalizes competition over cooperation, accumulation over distribution, growth over sufficiency. Alternative economic arrangements—gift economies, commons-based production, solidarity economies—appear as primitive or utopian deviations from the natural order, rather than as viable alternatives with their own logic and advantages.

Creative Utilitarianism begins elsewhere: not with scarcity but with flow. The fundamental economic reality is not the finite stock of goods but the ongoing process of value creation. Value is not a substance to be divided but a current to be channeled. The question is never simply "How do we distribute what exists?" but always "How do we organize the ongoing creation of what might exist?"

**Karl Polanyi** (1886-1964), the economic historian, demonstrated in "The Great Transformation" that market society is neither natural nor inevitable. For most of human history, economic activity was embedded in social relations—kinship, religion, politics—and only in the modern period did it become "disembedded," subject to its own autonomous laws. This disembedding was not spontaneous but required massive state intervention: enclosures of common land, poor laws that forced labor into the market, colonial extraction that provided raw materials and markets. The "free market" is as much a product of political construction as any planned economy.`

            heading: 'The Critique of Capitalism',
            content: `**Karl Marx** (1818-1883), the revolutionary philosopher, provided the definitive critique of capitalism as a system of exploitation. While we do not embrace historical materialism in its deterministic form, we retain Marx's understanding of alienation—the way in which capitalist relations separate workers from the products of their labor, from the labor process itself, from their fellow workers, and from their own human potential.

Marx identified the central dynamic of capitalism: the extraction of surplus value. Workers are paid wages for their labor power, but the value they produce exceeds these wages. The difference—surplus value—is appropriated by the owners of capital. This is not theft in the conventional sense (workers "freely" sell their labor power) but a structural inequality built into the wage relation itself.

The contemporary relevance of this analysis is undeniable. While real wages have stagnated for decades in much of the developed world, productivity has continued to rise. The gains have flowed to owners of capital, producing levels of wealth inequality not seen since the Gilded Age. The top 1% now owns as much wealth as the bottom 50% of humanity. A handful of individuals—Bezos, Musk, Gates, Zuckerberg—command resources exceeding those of many nation-states.

**Thomas Piketty** (b. 1971), the French economist, has demonstrated empirically what Marx argued theoretically: capitalism tends toward ever-increasing inequality. When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth (r > g), inherited wealth grows faster than earned income, and society drifts toward oligarchy. The mid-20th century, with its relatively egalitarian distribution, was the exception; the current return to Gilded-Age inequality is the norm.

But the Marxist tradition has also produced alternatives. **G.A. Cohen** (1941-2009), the analytical Marxist philosopher, developed rigorous arguments for socialist institutions based on principles of self-ownership and equality. **Erik Olin Wright** (1947-2019), the sociologist, articulated "real utopias"—actually existing alternatives to capitalism that could be scaled and connected. **David Harvey** (b. 1935), the geographer, has analyzed the spatial dynamics of capitalism, showing how capital resolves its crises through "spatial fixes" that displace rather than resolve contradictions.`

            heading: 'Automation and the Future of Work',
            content: `This shift in perspective transforms our understanding of automation. In the scarcity framework, automation appears as a threat—machines replacing workers, fewer jobs for more people, a race to the bottom of human redundancy. But in the flow framework, automation appears as opportunity—the liberation of human creative capacity from routine labor, the opening of new channels for value creation, the acceleration of the creative advance into novelty.

The key insight is that value does not disappear when work is automated; it is transformed. What was once captured as wages now flows as surplus. The political question—the question that will define our century—is how that surplus will be channeled. Will it concentrate in ever-fewer hands, accelerating the dynamic of capture and extraction? Or will it flow outward, supporting new forms of creative activity, funding new experiments in collective flourishing?

**John Maynard Keynes** (1883-1946), in his 1930 essay "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren," predicted that technological progress would reduce the necessary work week to 15 hours within a century. We have the productive capacity to fulfill Keynes's vision; we lack only the political will to distribute the gains from productivity. Instead, we have witnessed the "bullshit jobs" phenomenon identified by **David Graeber** (1961-2020)—the proliferation of meaningless work, administrative and supervisory roles that contribute nothing to production but maintain the fiction that everyone must work to deserve income.

**Aaron Bastani** (b. 1984), in "Fully Automated Luxury Communism," argues that emerging technologies—renewable energy, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, asteroid mining—make possible a society of material abundance, in which the necessities of life are freely available to all. This is not utopian fantasy but extrapolation from existing technological trends. The obstacle is not technological but political: the institutions of capitalism that require scarcity for profitability, that would rather destroy surplus than distribute it freely.

Creative Utilitarianism argues for the latter path. Through tokenization, we can create new mechanisms for distributing the fruits of automation. Through decentralized governance, we can ensure that the flows of value are channeled democratically. Through the cultivation of capabilities, we can prepare persons to thrive in an economy where routine labor is increasingly performed by machines.`

            heading: 'The Creator Economy',
            content: `The "creator economy" represents both promise and warning. On one hand, digital platforms have democratized cultural production, enabling anyone to publish, perform, and sell creative work to global audiences. YouTubers, podcasters, newsletter writers, indie game developers, musicians on Bandcamp, artists on Patreon—millions of people now earn income from creative work that would have been impossible before the internet.

On the other hand, the creator economy reproduces many of capitalism's pathologies. Platform monopolies extract value from creators through fees, advertising revenue, algorithmic manipulation. The winner-take-all dynamics of attention markets concentrate success in a tiny fraction of creators, while the "median" creator earns next to nothing. The pressure of constant content production leads to burnout, anxiety, and the commodification of every aspect of life.

**Jaron Lanier** (b. 1960), the virtual reality pioneer and technology critic, has proposed that the digital economy is fundamentally broken because information is undervalued. We give away our data—our creative work, our attention, our personal information—and receive in return "free" services that monetize us. His solution: micropayments for data, a universal basic data dividend, structures that compensate people for the value they create.

**Nick Srnicek** (b. 1982), in "Platform Capitalism," analyzes how digital platforms have become the dominant form of economic organization, extracting value through their position as intermediaries. The solution is not more regulation of existing platforms but the creation of alternative platforms with different ownership structures. Platform cooperativism—platforms owned and governed by their users—represents one such alternative.

The Utility Foundation's approach to the creator economy emphasizes infrastructure and ownership. Rather than competing with existing platforms for creator attention, we build the tools that enable creators to maintain ownership and control. Blockchain-based ownership records, smart contract royalties, decentralized distribution networks—these technologies can shift power from platforms to creators, enabling a creator economy that is genuinely creative rather than merely extractive.`

            heading: 'Solidarity Economics',
            content: `Across the world, outside the spotlight of mainstream economics, millions of people participate in alternative economic arrangements that embody principles of solidarity, reciprocity, and care. **Solidarity economics**, as theorized by **Ethan Miller** and others, encompasses these diverse practices: worker cooperatives, community currencies, time banks, gift circles, community land trusts, participatory budgeting, mutual aid networks.

**Worker cooperatives** are enterprises owned and governed by their workers. Unlike capitalist firms, where workers sell their labor power and owners appropriate the surplus, cooperatives distribute surplus among members according to principles they collectively determine. Studies consistently show that cooperatives are more resilient than conventional firms, have higher worker satisfaction, and often outperform on productivity measures.

**Community currencies** are locally issued money that circulates within a community, keeping value local rather than flowing to distant financial centers. Time banks exchange hours of labor directly, bypassing money entirely. Community land trusts remove land from the speculative market, securing affordable housing in perpetuity. Each of these represents an experiment in economic organization, a prefigurative practice that builds the infrastructure of a different economy.

**Participatory budgeting**, pioneered in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989, enables citizens to directly allocate portions of public budgets. Rather than representatives deciding how to spend tax revenue, communities deliberate together about priorities and investments. The practice has spread to thousands of cities worldwide, demonstrating that democratic governance of economic decisions is practical at scale.

**Mutual aid**, theorized by **Peter Kropotkin** (1842-1921) as a factor of evolution as important as competition, has experienced a revival in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mutual aid networks sprang up in communities worldwide, providing food, medicine, and support to those in need. These networks demonstrated capacities for rapid mobilization and caring response that bureaucratic institutions could not match.

The Graine Ledger, our agricultural automation subsidiary, exemplifies solidarity economics in practice. By bringing blockchain verification to supply chains, we ensure that value flows to those who create it—the farmers, the workers, the communities. By automating routine monitoring and verification, we free human attention for higher-order activities. The goal is not efficiency alone but justice: an economy in which the benefits of automation are widely shared.`

            heading: 'The Commons',
            content: `**Elinor Ostrom** (1933-2012), the political scientist and first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, demonstrated that communities can successfully manage common resources without either privatization or state control—contrary to the predictions of economic theory. Her studies of fisheries, forests, and irrigation systems around the world revealed that actual human communities develop sophisticated governance systems for shared resources, systems that work because humans are capable of cooperation, trust, and collective action.

Ostrom identified eight design principles for successful commons governance:

1. **Clearly defined boundaries**: The group and its resources must be clearly defined.
2. **Proportional equivalence between benefits and costs**: Those who benefit from the commons contribute proportionally to its maintenance.
3. **Collective choice arrangements**: Those affected by rules can participate in modifying them.
4. **Monitoring**: Conditions and member behavior are monitored.
5. **Graduated sanctions**: Sanctions for rule violations start small and escalate.
6. **Conflict resolution mechanisms**: Fast, low-cost means for resolving disputes.
7. **Minimal recognition of rights to organize**: External authorities recognize the community's right to organize.
8. **Nested enterprises**: For larger commons, governance is organized in nested layers.

These principles apply not only to natural resources but to any shared asset: knowledge, software, creative works, public spaces. The digital commons—Wikipedia, open-source software, Creative Commons content—represents one of the great achievements of collective human production. The challenge is to extend commons governance to ever-larger domains, including domains where market and state have failed.

**David Bollier** (b. 1953), activist and scholar, has articulated a vision of "commoning" as a social practice—not merely a resource but an activity, a form of life. The commons is not given but made, through ongoing relationships of care, negotiation, and collaboration. Commoning is prefigurative politics: we build the world we want by practicing the relationships it requires.

Creative Utilitarianism embraces the commons as a central organizing principle. Our technologies—blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized protocols—provide tools for commons governance at scale. Our organizational practices—distributed coordination, stakeholder governance, transparency—model commoning in action. We do not claim to have solved the problems of commons governance, but we contribute our experiments to the collective learning of the commoning community.`
